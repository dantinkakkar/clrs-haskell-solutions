# clrs-haskell-solutions
Solved some of theexercises in CLRS in Haskell

This repository contains solutions to some interesting problems found in Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS. I am working through the book again, whilst attempting to solve some of the exercises in idiomatic Haskell. The primary purpose of creating this repository was to keep a track of these solutions for my own use, but please feel free to use them in accordance with the license attached.

Some TODOs:

[ ] Reorganise the repository into directories by chapter

[ ] Add explanations and/or READMEs to problems wherever so required

[ ] Attempt to use a *.lhs (Literate Haskell) format if possible to show explained solutions
